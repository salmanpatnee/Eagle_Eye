    <h3>1. Security and Risk Management</h3>
    <h4>How this domain can be implemented:</h4>
    <p>
        Security and Risk Management involves defining security governance, risk management, compliance, and security
        awareness programs. Organizations must establish formal security policies, perform regular risk assessments using
        ISO 27005 and NIST 800-30, and align security objectives with business goals. Compliance with frameworks like
        <strong>ISO 27001, NIST CSF, SAMA Cybersecurity Framework, and NCA</strong> is essential. Risk management processes
        should include risk identification, analysis, treatment, and monitoring. Security training programs must be
        developed to create awareness among employees. Additionally, a strong
        <strong>Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)</strong> ensure resilience against security
        incidents.

        to limit attack surfaces. <strong>Firewall configurations, Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS),
            VPNs, and Network Access Control (NAC)</strong> should be deployed to ensure secure access.
        <strong>Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</strong> principles must be enforced, ensuring that no device or user
        is trusted by default. <strong>Securing wireless networks</strong> with <strong>WPA3 encryption and disabling SSID
            broadcasts</strong>
        prevents unauthorized access. Implementing <strong>TLS 1.3 encryption, email security protocols (DMARC, DKIM, SPF),
