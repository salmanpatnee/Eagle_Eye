    Zero Trust
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Zero Trust is a cybersecurity framework that follows the principle of "never trust, always verify," ensuring that all
        users, devices, and network components are continuously authenticated and authorized before being granted access.
        Unlike traditional perimeter-based security models, Zero Trust assumes that threats exist both inside and outside
        the network. It enforces strict identity verification, least-privilege access, and continuous monitoring to mitigate
        risks. The architecture is built on several key technologies, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), endpoint
        security, identity and access management (IAM), network segmentation, and behavioral analytics</p>
    <p>Zero Trust models rely on micro-segmentation to minimize lateral movement in the event of a breach. By segmenting
        networks into smaller zones, organizations can restrict access to only those resources necessary for specific users
        or applications. Continuous monitoring and adaptive access controls leverage AI-driven analytics to detect anomalies
        and enforce security policies dynamically. Additionally, Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) replaces traditional VPNs,
        providing secure access based on user identity, device posture, and contextual factors rather than relying solely on
        network location.
    </p>
    <p>The adoption of cloud computing, remote work, and IoT devices has made Zero Trust an essential cybersecurity
        strategy. Organizations are increasingly implementing Software-Defined Perimeters (SDP) and Security Service Edge
        (SSE) solutions to extend Zero Trust principles across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Future developments in
        Zero Trust will focus on AI-driven threat detection, automation, and integration with Extended Detection and
        Response (XDR) platforms to create a more proactive cybersecurity posture. The shift from implicit trust models to
        Zero Trust ensures a more resilient and adaptive security framework.
