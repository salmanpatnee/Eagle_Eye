    Backup Recovery
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Backup and recovery technologies are essential components of an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity and disaster recovery
        strategy. These solutions ensure that data is securely stored, replicated, and recoverable in case of cyber threats,
        hardware failures, accidental deletions, or natural disasters. Modern backup solutions leverage incremental,
        differential, and full backup methodologies to optimize storage efficiency and ensure business continuity.
        Organizations deploy on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid backup solutions to meet their specific security,
        compliance, and operational needs. Encryption and access controls further strengthen backup security to prevent
        unauthorized access and tampering.</p>
    <p>In response to evolving cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware attacks, backup and recovery solutions have
        integrated advanced security features, including immutable storage, air-gapped backups, and AI-powered anomaly
        detection. These capabilities help organizations maintain the integrity of their backup data and reduce the risk of
        data loss due to malware encryption. Disaster recovery solutions also support automated failover mechanisms,
        ensuring minimal downtime and rapid restoration of critical systems and applications in case of an incident.</p>
    <p>With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, backup solutions have evolved to support multi-cloud and hybrid
        environments. Cloud-based backup and disaster recovery as a service (BaaS & DRaaS) enable organizations to achieve
        scalability, cost-efficiency, and geographic redundancy. AI and machine learning play a crucial role in optimizing
        backup strategies, predicting failures, and enhancing data deduplication. Future trends indicate a strong shift
        towards zero-trust backup architectures, AI-driven automation, and compliance-focused data protection strategies to
        address regulatory requirements and cybersecurity challenges.</p>
