Encryption 
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Encryption is a fundamental component of endpoint security that ensures data confidentiality by converting readable
        information into an unreadable format, which can only be decrypted with an authorized key. As endpoints, such as
        laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and removable storage, become prime targets for cyber threats, encryption helps
        prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Endpoint encryption technologies safeguard data at rest, in transit,
        and in use, ensuring protection against cyberattacks, insider threats, and accidental data leaks. Organizations
        implement endpoint encryption solutions to comply with regulatory frameworks and protect intellectual property,
        customer data, and financial information.</p>
    <p>Modern endpoint encryption solutions use various encryption standards, including Advanced Encryption Standard
        (AES-256), RSA, and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). These solutions are integrated into endpoint security
        platforms, offering features such as full disk encryption (FDE), file-level encryption (FLE), email encryption, and
        encrypted USB drives. Some advanced encryption tools leverage hardware-based security modules (HSM) and Trusted
        Platform Modules (TPM) to enhance key management and prevent unauthorized decryption attempts. Additionally,
        encryption is increasingly integrated with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
        solutions to provide layered protection against cyber threats.
    </p>
    <p>With the rise of remote work, cloud computing, and regulatory compliance requirements, encryption technologies have
        evolved to support seamless key management, cloud-based encryption, and zero-trust security frameworks. AI-driven
        encryption solutions now dynamically adapt encryption policies based on user behavior and risk levels. The future of
        endpoint encryption will focus on quantum-resistant encryption, AI-powered automation, and tighter integration with
        access control mechanisms to enhance data security in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</p>
