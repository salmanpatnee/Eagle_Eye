    Wifi Security

@section('background')
    <p>WiFi security is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity, ensuring that wireless networks remain protected from
        unauthorized access, eavesdropping, and cyber threats. As organizations rely increasingly on wireless connectivity
        for business operations, securing WiFi infrastructure has become a priority. WiFi security involves various
        protocols, encryption mechanisms, and authentication techniques designed to prevent attacks such as
        man-in-the-middle (MITM), rogue access points, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Modern WiFi security standards,
        such as WPA3, provide enhanced encryption and authentication methods to safeguard wireless communications.</p>
    <p>WiFi security solutions include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), endpoint security,
        and network access control (NAC) mechanisms. These solutions help monitor wireless network traffic, detect
        anomalies, and enforce security policies. Secure authentication protocols such as IEEE 802.1X with Extensible
        Authentication Protocol (EAP) provide enterprise-grade authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can
        access the network. Additionally, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Secure Web Gateways (SWGs) further enhance
        WiFi security by encrypting data traffic and preventing cyber threats.
    </p>
    <p>The evolution of WiFi security is moving towards AI-driven threat detection and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).
        Organizations are implementing network segmentation and software-defined perimeters (SDP) to minimize the attack
        surface. The adoption of cloud-managed WiFi security solutions enables centralized policy enforcement and real-time
        threat monitoring. With the rapid expansion of IoT devices, securing WiFi networks is more critical than ever,
        requiring advanced anomaly detection, behavioral analytics, and continuous authentication to prevent unauthorized
        access and data breaches.
