    IoT Security
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized industries by connecting devices, sensors, and systems to enhance
        automation, efficiency, and real-time monitoring. However, the proliferation of IoT devices has introduced
        significant cybersecurity challenges, as these devices often lack built-in security controls. IoT security
        technologies focus on protecting connected devices from cyber threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches,
        Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and firmware manipulation. Key components of IoT security include
        identity management, encryption, network segmentation, anomaly detection, and secure firmware updates.</p>
    <p>IoT security solutions leverage AI-driven anomaly detection, behavior analysis, and zero-trust security models to
        monitor and protect IoT ecosystems. Network-based security mechanisms, such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention
        Systems (IDPS) and firewalls, are deployed to prevent unauthorized traffic from reaching IoT devices. Secure
        communication protocols, including Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH), help encrypt data
        transmissions between devices, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, device authentication
        and access control solutions, such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), play a
        crucial role in preventing unauthorized access to IoT networks.
    </p>
    <p>With the rise of smart cities, industrial IoT (IIoT), and critical infrastructure digitization, IoT security
        continues to be a top priority for organizations. The future of IoT security lies in AI-enhanced threat detection,
        blockchain-based device identity management, and the integration of IoT security with broader cybersecurity
        frameworks such as Secure Access Service Edge (SASE). As regulatory requirements evolve, organizations must
        implement robust IoT security policies to ensure compliance with data protection laws and cybersecurity standards.
