Network Access Control (NAC)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Network Access Control (NAC) is a cybersecurity technology that enforces security policies on devices attempting to access an organization's network. NAC ensures that only authorized and compliant devices are permitted network access, preventing unauthorized or compromised devices from connecting. NAC solutions verify users and endpoint security posture before granting network access, reducing the risk of malware infections, unauthorized access, and data breaches. By integrating authentication, endpoint compliance checks, and policy enforcement, NAC strengthens an organization's network security posture.</p>
    <p>Traditional NAC solutions focused on role-based access control and identity verification. However, with the rise of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Internet of Things (IoT), and hybrid work environments, NAC has evolved to incorporate behavioral analytics, risk-based access controls, and integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems. Modern NAC solutions utilize Zero Trust principles by continuously assessing the security posture of connected devices and applying network segmentation to limit lateral movement in case of compromise.
    </p>
    <p>As organizations shift towards cloud-based and software-defined networking (SDN) infrastructures, NAC solutions are evolving to support hybrid IT environments. AI-driven NAC solutions enhance threat detection by identifying anomalous behaviors and automating security responses. The future of NAC lies in its ability to integrate with extended detection and response (XDR), security orchestration automation and response (SOAR), and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) frameworks to provide adaptive and intelligent network access control.
