    Data Classification Technologies
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Data classification is a fundamental cybersecurity practice that involves categorizing data based on its sensitivity,
        confidentiality, and regulatory requirements. By classifying data, organizations can apply appropriate security
        measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, breaches, and leaks. Data classification
        technologies utilize automated discovery tools, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to identify,
        tag, and categorize data across structured and unstructured sources. These solutions help organizations enforce
        access controls, encryption, and retention policies based on data sensitivity.</p>
    <p>With increasing regulatory compliance mandates such as GDPR, HIPAA, and the Saudi PDPL, organizations are required to
        classify and protect personal, financial, and business-critical data. Modern data classification solutions integrate
        with data loss prevention (DLP) tools, cloud access security brokers (CASB), and security information and event
        management (SIEM) systems to enhance data protection. These solutions also provide real-time visibility into data
        movement and usage patterns, helping organizations mitigate risks associated with insider threats and cyberattacks.
    </p>
    <p>As data continues to grow exponentially across cloud and on-premises environments, data classification technologies
        are evolving to support hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures. AI-driven classification improves accuracy by
        detecting patterns, context, and metadata, allowing security teams to automate policy enforcement. The future of
        data classification will focus on real-time data protection, zero-trust security integration, and compliance
        automation to address emerging data privacy challenges and threats.</p>
