    User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is an advanced cybersecurity technology that leverages machine learning
        (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect anomalies in user and entity behaviors. Unlike traditional security
        monitoring solutions that rely on rule-based detection, UEBA focuses on establishing baselines for normal behavior
        and identifying deviations that may indicate insider threats, compromised credentials, or advanced persistent
        threats (APTs). UEBA analyzes vast amounts of data from endpoints, applications, networks, and cloud environments to
        provide security teams with context-aware insights.</p>
    <p>UEBA solutions are particularly effective in identifying low and slow attacks that evade traditional security
        controls. By monitoring behavioral patterns over time, these solutions can detect subtle changes in access patterns,
        login behaviors, and system interactions that may indicate unauthorized activity. UEBA integrates with Security
        Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), and Identity and
        Access Management (IAM) solutions to provide real-time threat intelligence and incident response capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>As cyber threats continue to evolve, UEBA is becoming a key component of Zero Trust Security frameworks. The future
        of UEBA involves deeper integration with Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platforms, AI-driven security
        analytics, and autonomous threat remediation. Organizations implementing UEBA benefit from enhanced visibility into
        security risks, improved insider threat detection, and proactive security response mechanisms to mitigate cyber
        threats effectively.
