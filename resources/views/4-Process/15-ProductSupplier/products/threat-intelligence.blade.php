    Threat Intelligence
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Threat intelligence is a cybersecurity discipline that involves collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about
        potential and emerging cyber threats. This technology helps organizations proactively defend against cyberattacks by
        providing insights into threat actors, attack techniques, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and tactics, techniques,
        and procedures (TTPs). Threat intelligence sources include open-source intelligence (OSINT), commercial threat
        feeds, dark web monitoring, and internal security data from an organizationâ€™s network and endpoints. By leveraging
        threat intelligence, organizations can enhance their security posture, prioritize threat mitigation efforts, and
        respond to cyber threats more effectively.</p>
    <p>Modern threat intelligence solutions integrate machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to automate
        threat analysis and provide actionable insights in real-time. These solutions classify and correlate threat data,
        enabling security teams to identify malicious activities before they impact critical systems. Threat intelligence
        platforms (TIPs) facilitate collaboration by integrating with security operations tools such as Security Information
        and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Security Orchestration, Automation, and
        Response (SOAR). This integration helps security teams analyze threats in context and accelerate incident response.
    </p>
    <p>As cyber threats evolve, the future of threat intelligence lies in automation, predictive analytics, and deeper
        integration with cybersecurity frameworks. Organizations are shifting towards intelligence-driven security
        operations to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) and zero-day vulnerabilities before exploitation.
        Additionally, threat intelligence sharing among enterprises, governments, and industry groups enhances collective
        defense strategies. AI-driven threat intelligence will continue to play a vital role in strengthening cybersecurity
        resilience against evolving attack vectors and emerging threats.
