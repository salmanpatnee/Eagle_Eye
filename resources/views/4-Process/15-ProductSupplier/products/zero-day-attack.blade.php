    Zero Day Attack
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Zero-day attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or firmware that are unknown to vendors and security
        researchers. These attacks occur before a fix or patch is available, making them particularly dangerous.
        Cybercriminals leverage zero-day vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, steal
        sensitive data, or disrupt critical operations. Given the unpredictable nature of these attacks, organizations must
        adopt advanced security measures such as real-time threat intelligence, behavior-based detection, and machine
        learning-driven anomaly detection to mitigate risks.</p>
    <p>Traditional signature-based antivirus and firewall solutions are ineffective against zero-day attacks because they
        rely on known threat patterns. Instead, modern security technologies use heuristic analysis, sandboxing, and
        artificial intelligence (AI) to detect suspicious behavior. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Extended
        Detection and Response (XDR), and Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) incorporate zero-day threat detection mechanisms
        that analyze network traffic and application behavior to identify anomalies indicative of an exploit attempt.
        Security vendors also leverage crowdsourced threat intelligence to proactively detect emerging threats before they
        become widespread.
    </p>
    <p>The increasing adoption of cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and remote work environments has
        expanded the attack surface for zero-day exploits. Organizations must implement Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to
        minimize the impact of zero-day attacks. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions, together with
        AI-driven cybersecurity frameworks, enable proactive monitoring and automated response mechanisms. The future of
        zero-day attack mitigation lies in AI-powered predictive analytics, automated patch management, and global threat
        intelligence sharing to reduce the time between vulnerability discovery and remediation.
