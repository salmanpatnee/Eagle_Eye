Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) is a security technology designed to track, analyze, and report database activities in real time. DAM solutions provide visibility into user behavior, database transactions, and unauthorized access attempts, helping organizations protect sensitive information from insider threats, unauthorized access, and cyberattacks. Unlike traditional security solutions that focus on network perimeter defenses, DAM operates at the database level, detecting suspicious activities such as privilege abuse, SQL injection attacks, and data exfiltration attempts.</p>
    <p>Modern DAM solutions incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance anomaly detection and automate security responses. These technologies help identify abnormal data access patterns, unauthorized modifications, and privileged user activities that may indicate a security breach. DAM tools also integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems to provide a comprehensive security posture. Additionally, DAM solutions enforce security policies, generate audit reports for compliance, and support real-time alerts to mitigate database-related threats.
    </p>
    <p>With stringent regulatory compliance requirements such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and the Saudi PDPL, organizations are increasingly deploying DAM solutions to safeguard their data. As businesses migrate to cloud and hybrid environments, DAM tools have evolved to support multi-cloud deployments, containerized databases, and serverless architectures. The future of DAM will focus on AI-driven predictive analytics, zero-trust security principles, and tighter integration with cloud-native security frameworks to enhance data protection and threat mitigation.</p>
