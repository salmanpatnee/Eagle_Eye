    Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) technology serves as a security checkpoint between cloud service providers and enterprise users to ensure the secure use of cloud applications and services. With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, organizations face challenges related to data security, compliance, and access control. CASB solutions provide visibility into cloud usage, enforce security policies, and protect against cloud-based threats such as unauthorized access, data leakage, and insider threats. They act as intermediaries between users and cloud environments, offering security controls like encryption, access control, threat detection, and compliance enforcement.</p>
    <p>A CASB operates using four primary pillars: visibility, compliance, data security, and threat protection. Visibility ensures that organizations can monitor and control shadow IT and unsanctioned cloud applications. Compliance enforcement helps businesses adhere to industry regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 by implementing data security policies. Data protection features include encryption, tokenization, and data loss prevention (DLP) to safeguard sensitive information stored in the cloud. Threat protection capabilities detect and prevent malware, phishing attacks, and account hijacking attempts through behavior analytics and anomaly detection.</p>
    <p>As cloud adoption grows, CASB solutions have evolved to integrate with other security technologies, including Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), and Identity and Access Management (IAM). Organizations deploy CASB in various modes such as API-based security, proxy-based control, and agentless deployment to secure cloud applications across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. The future of CASB lies in AI-driven automation, deep behavioral analytics, and enhanced cloud-native security controls to address emerging threats in cloud ecosystems.</p>
