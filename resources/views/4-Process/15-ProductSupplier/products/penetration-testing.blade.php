    Penetration Testing
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, is a cybersecurity practice designed to simulate real-world
        attacks on an organization’s IT infrastructure, applications, and networks. The objective of penetration testing is
        to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. It involves a systematic approach, including
        reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation activities. Security
        professionals use penetration testing to assess an organization's security posture and provide recommendations for
        remediation.</p>
    <p>Penetration testing technologies have evolved to include both manual and automated testing tools. Manual penetration
        testing is conducted by ethical hackers using various tools and techniques to mimic an attacker’s behavior.
        Automated penetration testing solutions use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to identify
        vulnerabilities in real time, reducing the time required for assessments. Advanced penetration testing technologies
        also include Red Teaming, which simulates persistent attack scenarios, and Purple Teaming, where offensive and
        defensive teams collaborate to improve security defenses.
    </p>
    <p>With the rise of cloud computing, IoT devices, and remote work environments, penetration testing technologies have
        expanded to cover cloud security assessments, mobile application security, and API security testing. Modern
        penetration testing tools integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and
        Response (XDR) solutions to provide continuous monitoring and proactive threat mitigation. The future of penetration
        testing is driven by AI-powered threat simulations, attack surface management (ASM), and automated red teaming to
        enhance security resilience.
