    Email Security
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Email remains one of the primary communication tools for organizations worldwide, but it is also one of the most
        targeted attack vectors by cybercriminals. Email security technologies protect against a wide range of threats,
        including phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC), malware, ransomware, and spam. These solutions use various
        techniques such as email authentication, advanced threat detection, sandboxing, encryption, and artificial
        intelligence (AI)-driven anomaly detection to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate risks associated with
        malicious emails.</p>
    <p>Modern email security solutions incorporate technologies such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and
        Conformance (DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to verify sender
        authenticity and prevent email spoofing. Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) act as the first line of defense by filtering
        inbound and outbound emails, identifying threats, and blocking malicious content before it reaches end-users.
        Additionally, cloud-based email security solutions leverage AI and machine learning to detect emerging threats,
        ensuring real-time protection against sophisticated cyberattacks.
    </p>
    <p>With the increasing adoption of cloud email services such as Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, organizations are
        integrating email security technologies with cloud access security brokers (CASB), data loss prevention (DLP), and
        security information and event management (SIEM) systems. Future advancements in email security will focus on
        AI-driven automation, deep behavioral analytics, and zero-trust-based email authentication models to enhance
        resilience against evolving cyber threats.</p>
