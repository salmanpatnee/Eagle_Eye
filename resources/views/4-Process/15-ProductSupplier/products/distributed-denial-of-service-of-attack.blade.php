Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack Technologies
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a cyber threat in which multiple compromised systems are used to flood a targeted server, network, or application with excessive traffic, overwhelming its capacity and causing service disruptions. These attacks are often executed using botnets, where a large number of infected devices generate malicious traffic to exhaust the target's resources. DDoS attacks come in various forms, including volumetric attacks, protocol attacks, and application-layer attacks, each designed to exploit different aspects of a network or system to achieve disruption.</p>
    <p>To counter DDoS threats, organizations deploy specialized DDoS mitigation solutions that use traffic filtering, rate limiting, and behavioral analysis to detect and mitigate malicious traffic before it reaches critical infrastructure. Modern DDoS protection solutions employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to identify attack patterns and differentiate between legitimate and malicious traffic in real time. Cloud-based DDoS protection services provide scalable defenses by leveraging global traffic distribution networks and scrubbing centers to absorb and neutralize large-scale attacks.
    </p>
    <p>As cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, organizations must adopt a multi-layered approach to DDoS protection, integrating mitigation tools with Web Application Firewalls (WAF), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions. DDoS resilience strategies also include geo-blocking, rate limiting, and automated response mechanisms to minimize downtime. The future of DDoS defense lies in predictive analytics, automated threat intelligence sharing, and hybrid cloud-based protection to enhance network resilience and business continuity</p>
