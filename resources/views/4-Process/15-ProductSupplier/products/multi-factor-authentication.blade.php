    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security technology designed to enhance authentication by requiring users to
        provide two or more verification factors to access an account, system, or application. This technology significantly
        reduces the risk of unauthorized access, as attackers would need to compromise multiple authentication factors. MFA
        typically incorporates a combination of knowledge factors (something the user knows, like a password or PIN),
        possession factors (something the user has, like a security token or mobile authenticator), and inherence factors
        (something the user is, like biometrics such as fingerprints or facial recognition).</p>
    <p>Traditional single-factor authentication methods, such as passwords, are highly vulnerable to attacks like phishing,
        brute-force attempts, and credential stuffing. MFA mitigates these risks by requiring additional authentication
        layers, making unauthorized access much more difficult. Modern MFA solutions use adaptive authentication, where
        risk-based policies analyze contextual information such as user behavior, device, location, and access history to
        determine the level of authentication required. This adaptive approach minimizes user friction while ensuring a
        higher level of security.
    </p>
    <p>With the increasing adoption of cloud services, remote work, and zero-trust architectures, MFA has become a critical
        component of enterprise security strategies. Organizations implement MFA across applications, endpoints, and
        privileged access environments to protect against account takeovers and insider threats. The future of MFA is driven
        by advancements in AI-powered authentication, passwordless authentication methods, and decentralized identity
        frameworks, improving both security and user experience.
