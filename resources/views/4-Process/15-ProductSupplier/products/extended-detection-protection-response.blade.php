Extended Detection Protection Response (XDR)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is an advanced cybersecurity technology that integrates multiple security layers into a unified detection, investigation, and response platform. Unlike traditional Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions that focus solely on endpoint threats, XDR extends visibility across networks, email, cloud environments, and applications. By correlating data from multiple security domains, XDR provides security teams with a holistic view of threats and enables faster detection and response.</p>
    <p>XDR solutions leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze security telemetry data, detect anomalies, and automate response actions. These platforms aggregate and normalize security alerts from various sources, reducing alert fatigue and providing security analysts with contextualized threat intelligence. Additionally, XDR solutions integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms to enhance security operations and threat mitigation strategies.
    </p>
    <p>As organizations face increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, XDR plays a critical role in strengthening their security posture. By unifying disparate security tools into a single interface, XDR simplifies threat hunting, incident analysis, and forensic investigations. The future of XDR will focus on further automation, predictive analytics, and zero-trust architecture integration to enhance cyber resilience against emerging threats.</p>
