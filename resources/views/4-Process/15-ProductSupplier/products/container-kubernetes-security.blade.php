Container and Kubernetes Security
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Container and Kubernetes security is a critical component of modern cloud-native application security. Containers provide a lightweight and scalable approach to application deployment, while Kubernetes serves as the orchestration platform that automates container management. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce new security risks such as container escape vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and supply chain attacks. Organizations must implement security measures across the container lifecycle, including secure image creation, runtime protection, and network security.</p>
    <p>Kubernetes security focuses on securing the control plane, worker nodes, and containerized workloads. Kubernetes clusters often interact with sensitive data, requiring strict access controls, encryption, and network segmentation. Security policies such as role-based access control (RBAC), pod security policies (PSP), and namespace isolation help prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, runtime security solutions continuously monitor container behavior to detect anomalies, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation attempts.</p>
    <p>With the rise of DevSecOps, integrating security into the container development pipeline has become essential. Security scanning tools for container images detect vulnerabilities before deployment, while policy-based enforcement ensures compliance with security best practices. Organizations also adopt container threat detection solutions that integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platforms. The future of container and Kubernetes security lies in AI-driven anomaly detection, service mesh security, and zero-trust networking models to enhance resilience against evolving cyber threats.</p>
