Privilege Access Management (PAM)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a cybersecurity technology designed to control, monitor, and secure access to critical IT infrastructure, applications, and sensitive data by privileged users. Privileged accounts, such as system administrators, database administrators, and network engineers, have elevated access to an organizationâ€™s IT systems, making them a primary target for cyber threats. PAM solutions provide a structured approach to managing and securing privileged credentials by enforcing least privilege policies, auditing privileged activity, and implementing just-in-time access principles.</p>
    <p>PAM solutions work by vaulting privileged credentials, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), and controlling privileged session access. These solutions prevent credential theft, mitigate insider threats, and enhance visibility into privileged user activities. Advanced PAM platforms incorporate AI-driven behavioral analytics to detect anomalies in privileged sessions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. By integrating with identity and access management (IAM) systems, PAM ensures that privileged users follow strict security protocols, reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement in case of a breach.
    </p>
    <p>With the growing adoption of cloud computing, remote work environments, and hybrid IT infrastructures, PAM solutions have evolved to support dynamic access control policies across multi-cloud and on-premise environments. The future of PAM is centered on Zero Trust Security, AI-driven threat detection, and Just-in-Time (JIT) access management, enabling organizations to implement proactive security controls for their privileged accounts while maintaining compliance with regulatory frameworks.
