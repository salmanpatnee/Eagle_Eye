    Web Application Firewall (WAF)
@endsection
@section('background')
    <p>Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are specialized security solutions designed to protect web applications from cyber
        threats, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. WAFs
        function by analyzing and filtering HTTP and HTTPS traffic between clients and web applications. Unlike traditional
        firewalls that focus on network security, WAFs operate at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, allowing
        them to identify and block malicious traffic targeting web applications.</p>
    <p>WAFs use a combination of rule-based filtering, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence to detect and mitigate
        attacks. They employ techniques such as signature-based detection, anomaly detection, and machine learning to
        differentiate legitimate traffic from potential threats. Some WAF solutions integrate with Content Delivery Networks
        (CDNs) and cloud-based security services to enhance application performance and scalability while maintaining robust
        security controls. Additionally, modern WAFs provide real-time monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities to
        help security teams respond to incidents proactively.
    </p>
    <p>As cyber threats continue to evolve, WAF technologies are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and automated
        security mechanisms to improve threat detection accuracy. Future WAF solutions are expected to integrate more
        seamlessly with Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platforms, Zero Trust security frameworks, and DevSecOps
        workflows. Organizations deploying WAFs benefit from enhanced protection against web-based attacks, improved
        compliance with data protection regulations, and a strengthened security posture for their digital assets.
