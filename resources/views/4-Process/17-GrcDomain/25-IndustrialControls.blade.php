    <h3>1. Description of the Vulnerability Management Technologies:</h3>
    <p>
        Vulnerability management is a proactive approach to identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating
        security vulnerabilities within an organization's IT environment.
        It involves continuous scanning, monitoring, and patching of systems to reduce exposure to cyber threats.
        Effective vulnerability management minimizes the attack surface, enhances security resilience, and ensures
        compliance with regulatory standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        A structured vulnerability management process includes asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, risk analysis,
        remediation, and ongoing monitoring.
        Organizations use vulnerability scanning tools, penetration testing, and automated patch management solutions to
        detect and resolve security gaps before
        they can be exploited by cybercriminals.
