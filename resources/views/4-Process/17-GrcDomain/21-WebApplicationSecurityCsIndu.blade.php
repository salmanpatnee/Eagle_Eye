        <h3>1. Description of the Cybersecurity Governance Technologies:</h3>
        <p>Electronic Banking Services (EBS) enable customers to conduct financial transactions through digital platforms,
            eliminating the need for physical bank visits. These services include internet banking, mobile banking, ATMs,
            point-of-sale (POS) transactions, and electronic fund transfers (EFT). They offer customers 24/7 access to their
            accounts,
            allowing them to manage their finances conveniently and securely.</p>
        <p>Security is a top priority in electronic banking, with banks implementing strong encryption, multi-factor
            authentication,
            and fraud detection systems to protect transactions. Additionally, banks integrate compliance standards to
            ensure secure
            and seamless banking operations. As financial technology advances, banks continue to enhance their digital
            services by
            offering faster transaction processing, biometric authentication, and AI-driven fraud prevention.</p>

        <h3>2. Basic Concepts of Electronic Banking Services</h3>
        <p>Electronic banking services, also known as e-banking or online banking, provide customers with convenient,
            digital access to financial transactions and services. These services include online fund transfers, bill
            payments, mobile banking, ATM transactions, and digital wallets. E-banking has revolutionized traditional
            banking by allowing customers to perform transactions anytime, anywhere, without visiting a physical branch.
            This not only enhances customer experience but also reduces operational costs for financial institutions.</p>
        <p>Security is a critical aspect of electronic banking services due to the risk of cyber threats such as phishing,
            identity theft, and fraud. To protect customer data and transactions, banks implement strong authentication
            mechanisms like two-factor authentication (2FA), encryption, and biometric verification. Compliance with
            cybersecurity regulations such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and ISO 27001
            ensures that banks follow best practices in securing electronic transactions. Additionally, fraud detection and
            monitoring systems help identify suspicious activities in real time, preventing unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>As technology advances, electronic banking services continue to evolve with innovations such as AI-driven
            chatbots, blockchain-based payments, and open banking frameworks. The integration of fintech solutions with
            traditional banking allows for more personalized financial services, making banking faster and more efficient.
            With increasing reliance on digital platforms, banks must continually invest in cybersecurity measures, customer
            education, and regulatory compliance to maintain trust and security in electronic banking services.</p>
