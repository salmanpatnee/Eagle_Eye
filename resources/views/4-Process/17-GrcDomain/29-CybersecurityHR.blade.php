    <h3>1. Description of Cybersecurity Risk Management Technologies:</h3>
    <p>Cybersecurity risk management technologies enable organizations to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor cyber threats while ensuring compliance with frameworks like NCA Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC) and NCA Critical Cybersecurity Controls (CSCC). These technologies include Risk Management Platforms, which help organizations document, assess, and track risks while automating compliance processes. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems analyze security logs in real time to detect threats and reduce the risk of cyber incidents. Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) provide insights into emerging threats and vulnerabilities, helping organizations proactively manage risks. Vulnerability Management Systems continuously scan IT environments to detect weaknesses before attackers exploit them. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Tools streamline risk reporting and compliance with cybersecurity policies. Additionally, Incident Response Platforms help organizations contain and mitigate security breaches, while Penetration Testing (PT) Tools simulate attacks to evaluate security defenses. These technologies work together to provide a comprehensive risk management framework that enhances an organization's cybersecurity resilience.</p>
