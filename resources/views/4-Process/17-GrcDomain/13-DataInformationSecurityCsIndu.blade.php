        <h3>1. Description of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Technologies:</h3>
        <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies, technologies, and processes designed to ensure
            that only authorized individuals have access to the right resources at the right time. IAM enhances security by
            managing user identities, enforcing authentication, and controlling access permissions across an organization's
            digital environment.</p>

        <h3>2. Basic Concepts of Identity and Access Management</h3>
        <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial component of cybersecurity that ensures the right individuals
            have the appropriate access to systems, applications, and data while preventing unauthorized access. IAM
            frameworks help organizations protect sensitive information by implementing authentication, authorization, and
            auditing processes to manage user identities and access privileges securely.</p>
        <p>A robust IAM system includes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Single Sign-On (SSO), Role-Based Access Control
            (RBAC), and Privileged Access Management (PAM). These measures ensure that users are authenticated properly
            before accessing resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, insider threats, and credential theft. IAM
            also plays a critical role in Zero Trust Security, where access is granted on a least-privilege basis, requiring
            continuous verification of user identity and behavior.</p>
        <p>IAM solutions also help organizations comply with regulatory requirements such as NIST, GDPR, ISO 27001, and NCA
            Cybersecurity Standards by maintaining detailed logs, audit trails, and access reviews. Implementing an
            effective IAM strategy ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, reducing cybersecurity risks
            while enhancing operational efficiency and user experience.</p>

        <h3>5. Summary</h3>
        <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is essential for securing an organizationâ€™s digital environment by enforcing
            authentication and access policies. By implementing IAM solutions such as SSO, MFA, RBAC, and PAM, organizations
            can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and insider threats. Key performance indicators like
            authentication success rate, MFA adoption, and unauthorized access attempts help measure IAM effectiveness.</p>
