    <h3>1. Description of the Cloud Computing Technologies:</h3>
    <p>
        Cloud computing is a technology that enables organizations to store, manage, and process data on remote servers
        rather than on local infrastructure.
        It provides on-demand access to computing resources, including storage, networking, and applications, allowing
        businesses to scale operations efficiently.
        However, cloud computing introduces security challenges such as data breaches, misconfigurations, compliance
        risks, and unauthorized access.
        Organizations must adopt strong security measures, including encryption, identity management, and continuous
        monitoring, to ensure cloud environments remain secure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Effective cloud security strategies involve selecting reputable cloud service providers (CSPs), implementing
        access controls, and regularly auditing cloud environments.
        Compliance with cloud security standards, such as the NCA Cloud Cybersecurity Controls, ensures organizations
        maintain regulatory compliance and mitigate cyber threats.
        By leveraging advanced security tools, organizations can detect and respond to cloud-based threats in real time.
