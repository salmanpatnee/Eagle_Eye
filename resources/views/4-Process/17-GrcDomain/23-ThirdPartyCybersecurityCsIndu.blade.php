        <h3>1. Description of the Cyber Security Incident Management Technologies:</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber Security Incident Management is the structured approach organizations use to detect, respond to, and
            recover from cybersecurity incidents.
            It involves identifying security breaches, containing threats, mitigating risks, and ensuring business
            continuity.
            A well-defined incident management process helps minimize the impact of security threats and prevents further
            damage to the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Incident management follows a systematic approach, typically comprising preparation, detection, containment,
            eradication, recovery,
            and post-incident analysis. Effective cybersecurity incident management ensures compliance with regulatory
            requirements, improves security posture,
            and enhances the organization's ability to handle cyber threats proactively.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Basic Concepts of Cyber Security Incident Management</h3>
        <p>Cyber Security Incident Management is the process of identifying, responding to, mitigating, and recovering from
            cybersecurity incidents that threaten an organization's data, systems, or operations. A well-structured incident
            management framework ensures that security breaches, malware infections, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and
            other threats are addressed in a timely and effective manner. Organizations follow predefined incident response
            plans to minimize the impact of security breaches and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>Incident management involves several key stages, including detection, analysis, containment, eradication,
            recovery, and post-incident review. The use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, threat
            intelligence platforms, and automated detection tools helps organizations quickly identify and assess security
            incidents. Once an incident is detected, containment measures are applied to prevent further damage, followed by
            the removal of threats and system recovery.</p>
        <p>A critical component of incident management is post-incident analysis and reporting, which helps organizations
            learn from past incidents and improve their security strategies. Incident reports document the cause of the
            attack, the effectiveness of the response, and recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future.
            Compliance with regulatory standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR mandates that organizations have a
            well-defined incident response plan in place to protect sensitive data and ensure business continuity.</p>
