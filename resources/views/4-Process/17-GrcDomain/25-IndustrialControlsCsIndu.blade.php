        <h3>1. Description of the Vulnerability Management Technologies:</h3>
        <p>
            Vulnerability management is a proactive approach to identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating
            security vulnerabilities within an organization's IT environment.
            It involves continuous scanning, monitoring, and patching of systems to reduce exposure to cyber threats.
            Effective vulnerability management minimizes the attack surface, enhances security resilience, and ensures
            compliance with regulatory standards.
        </p>

        <p>
            A structured vulnerability management process includes asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, risk analysis,
            remediation, and ongoing monitoring.
            Organizations use vulnerability scanning tools, penetration testing, and automated patch management solutions to
            detect and resolve security gaps before
            they can be exploited by cybercriminals.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Basic Concepts of Vulnerability Management</h3>
        <p>Vulnerability Management is a continuous process that involves identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and
            remediating security vulnerabilities within an organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure. Cyber threats are constantly
            evolving, and new vulnerabilities emerge regularly, making it essential for organizations to proactively manage
            and mitigate risks before they are exploited by attackers. This process includes conducting regular
            vulnerability scans, analyzing potential weaknesses, and applying necessary security patches or configurations
            to safeguard systems.</p>
        <p>A strong vulnerability management program follows a systematic approach, starting with asset discovery to
            identify all connected devices and applications. Once vulnerabilities are detected, organizations evaluate their
            severity based on risk factors such as exploitability and potential impact. This enables security teams to
            prioritize critical vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat. Automated tools like Vulnerability Assessment
            and Patch Management solutions help organizations streamline this process, ensuring efficient detection and
            response.</p>
        <p>Regular security audits, compliance checks, and penetration testing further strengthen vulnerability management
            by uncovering hidden weaknesses that automated scans might miss. Additionally, implementing security policies,
            employee awareness training, and continuous monitoring helps prevent misconfigurations and outdated software
            from becoming security risks. A well-structured vulnerability management framework reduces the attack surface,
            enhances organizational resilience, and ensures compliance with cybersecurity standards.</p>
