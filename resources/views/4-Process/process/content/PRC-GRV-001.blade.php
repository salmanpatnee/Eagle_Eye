    <h3>1. Description of the Cybersecurity Governance Technologies:</h3>
    <p>Cybersecurity governance refers to the framework that ensures the implementation and maintenance of
        security practices across an organization’s information systems. Technologies supporting governance
        involve tools that allow for the continuous monitoring, compliance, and reporting of cybersecurity
        controls and processes. These include Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, risk management
        platforms, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and compliance management software.
        Governance technologies ensure that organizations adhere to policies and frameworks like the National
        Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) standards, and they provide visibility into security operations, automate
        audits, enforce access controls, and maintain compliance with national and international regulations.
        These technologies enable organizations to manage cybersecurity risks, track performance, and make
        informed decisions about resource allocation and improvements.</p>
