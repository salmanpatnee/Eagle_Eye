    <h3>1. Description of the Application Security Technologies:</h3>
    <p>Application Security refers to the practice of protecting software applications from threats and vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycleâ€”from development to deployment and maintenance. It encompasses various security measures, including secure coding practices, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and security configurations. Given the increasing reliance on web and mobile applications, securing applications is critical to preventing data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyberattacks.</p>

    <h3>4. Summary</h3>
    <p> Application Security is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity, ensuring that applications are protected from
        vulnerabilities
        throughout their lifecycle. By implementing robust security practices such as SAST, DAST, and WAF, organizations
        can
        reduce their risk exposure and prevent cyber threats.</p>
    <p>
        Measuring KPIs like vulnerability remediation time, testing coverage, and penetration testing success rates
        helps organizations
        assess the effectiveness of their security efforts. Using industry-leading security products such as Burp Suite,
        OWASP ZAP, and
        Veracode enables organizations to align with NCA Application Security standards and build secure applications.
