    <h3>1. Description of the Payment Systems Technologies:</h3>
    <p>Payment systems are digital and electronic frameworks that facilitate financial transactions between consumers,
        businesses, and financial institutions. These systems include credit card networks, mobile payment platforms,
        online banking transfers, and digital wallets. Secure payment systems leverage encryption, multi-factor
        authentication (MFA), tokenization, and fraud detection mechanisms to protect users from cyber threats such as
        phishing, payment fraud, and unauthorized transactions. Compliance with industry standards like PCI DSS (Payment
        Card Industry Data Security Standard) and NCA Data Cybersecurity Controls ensures the confidentiality,
        integrity, and availability of financial data. As digital payment solutions continue to evolve, integrating
        AI-driven fraud prevention, blockchain security, and real-time monitoring enhances the overall security and
        reliability of payment ecosystems.</p>
