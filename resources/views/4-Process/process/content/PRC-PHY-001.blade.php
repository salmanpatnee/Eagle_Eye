    <h3>1. Description of Physical Security Technologies:</h3>
    <p>Physical security technologies are essential in protecting an organization’s critical IT infrastructure, data
        centers, and sensitive areas from unauthorized access, environmental hazards, and physical threats. These
        technologies include Access Control Systems (ACS), which use biometric authentication, RFID cards, and keypads
        to restrict entry to authorized personnel. Surveillance Systems (CCTV) continuously monitor security-sensitive
        areas to detect unauthorized activities. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) alert security teams about
        unauthorized access attempts. Environmental Monitoring Systems track temperature, humidity, and fire hazards in
        data centers to prevent physical damage to critical infrastructure. Smart Locks and Security Barriers reinforce
        physical protection by restricting entry to critical areas. Additionally, Visitor Management Systems (VMS)
        ensure that only authorized guests gain access to restricted zones. Asset Tracking Technologies, such as RFID
        and GPS tagging, help organizations monitor the location and movement of physical IT assets. Integrating these
        technologies into an NCA-compliant cybersecurity framework enhances security, prevents unauthorized access, and
        mitigates physical risks to IT assets.</p>

    <h3>4. Summary</h3>
    <p>Physical security is a critical component of an organization’s cybersecurity strategy, ensuring the protection of
        IT assets, data centers, and restricted areas from unauthorized access and environmental threats. Organizations
        must implement Access Control Systems, CCTV surveillance, intrusion detection, and environmental monitoring
        tools to ensure compliance with NCA Physical Security Standards. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as
        unauthorized access attempts, CCTV coverage efficiency, and incident response times help organizations assess
        and improve their physical security measures. By integrating advanced physical security technologies with
        cybersecurity frameworks, organizations can prevent security breaches, enhance asset protection, and strengthen
        resilience against physical threats.</p>
