    <h3>1. Description of the Threat Management Technologies:</h3>
    <p>
        Threat Management is a proactive cybersecurity strategy aimed at identifying, assessing, and mitigating security
        threats before they can cause harm.
        It involves continuous monitoring, threat intelligence, vulnerability assessments, and incident response to
        protect an organizationâ€™s digital assets.
        Effective threat management ensures that security teams can detect and respond to potential risks in real time,
        reducing the likelihood of cyberattacks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Threat management is built on key components such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Threat
        Intelligence Platforms, Endpoint Security,
        and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging these technologies, organizations can gain deeper
        visibility into their network, detect malicious
        activity early, and implement countermeasures to neutralize threats.
