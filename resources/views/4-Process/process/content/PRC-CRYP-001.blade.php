    <h3>1. Description of the Cryptography Technologies:</h3>
    <p>Cryptography is the foundation of secure communication in the digital world. It involves the use of mathematical techniques to protect data from unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Cryptographic methods include symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures. Organizations use cryptographic algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) to secure sensitive information, including user credentials, financial transactions, and confidential communications. Implementing strong cryptographic controls is essential for regulatory compliance, data protection, and securing both on-premises and cloud environments. As cyber threats evolve, cryptographic standards continue to improve, ensuring resilience against attacks such as brute force, quantum computing, and cryptanalysis.</p>
