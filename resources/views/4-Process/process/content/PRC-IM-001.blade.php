    <h3>1. Description of the Cyber Security Incident Management Technologies:</h3>
    <p>
        Cyber Security Incident Management is the structured approach organizations use to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. 
        It involves identifying security breaches, containing threats, mitigating risks, and ensuring business continuity. 
        A well-defined incident management process helps minimize the impact of security threats and prevents further damage to the organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Incident management follows a systematic approach, typically comprising preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, 
        and post-incident analysis. Effective cybersecurity incident management ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, improves security posture, 
        and enhances the organization's ability to handle cyber threats proactively.
