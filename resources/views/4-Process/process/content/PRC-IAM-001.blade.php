    <h3>1. Description of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Technologies:</h3>
    <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies, technologies, and processes designed to ensure
        that only authorized individuals have access to the right resources at the right time. IAM enhances security by
        managing user identities, enforcing authentication, and controlling access permissions across an organization's
        digital environment.</p>

    <h3>4. Summary</h3>
    <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is essential for securing an organizationâ€™s digital environment by enforcing
        authentication and access policies. By implementing IAM solutions such as SSO, MFA, RBAC, and PAM, organizations
        can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and insider threats. Key performance indicators like
        authentication success rate, MFA adoption, and unauthorized access attempts help measure IAM effectiveness.</p>
