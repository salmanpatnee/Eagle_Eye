    <h3>1. Description of Cybersecurity Strategy Technologies:</h3>
   <p>Cybersecurity strategy technologies provide organizations with the necessary tools and frameworks to protect their digital assets, manage risks, and ensure compliance with cybersecurity standards such as the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) controls. These technologies include Risk Management Platforms, which help in identifying, assessing, and mitigating cyber risks; Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems, which monitor and analyze security events in real time; Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions, which enforce access control policies; and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tools, which assist in policy enforcement and regulatory compliance. Additionally, Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) provide organizations with actionable intelligence on emerging threats, while Vulnerability Management Solutions help in proactively identifying and mitigating security gaps. These technologies collectively form the backbone of a cybersecurity strategy by ensuring continuous monitoring, rapid incident response, and alignment with security policies and frameworks like the NCA Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC).</p>
