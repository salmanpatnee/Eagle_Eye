    <h3>1. Description of the Cyber Security Architecture Technologies:</h3>
    <p>
        Cyber Security Architecture encompasses the design, implementation, and maintenance of security solutions to
        protect an organization's IT infrastructure, data, and systems. It involves multiple layers of defense,
        including network security, endpoint security, cloud security, and identity and access management. Key
        technologies include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), encryption, zero trust
        architecture, security information and event management (SIEM), and multi-factor authentication (MFA). These
        technologies work together to mitigate risks, detect threats, and ensure compliance with cybersecurity standards
        such as NCA Essential Cybersecurity Controls and NCA Data Cybersecurity Control. Organizations must continuously
        evolve their security architecture to counter emerging cyber threats and maintain a resilient security posture.
