    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Data and information are the most valuable assets of any organization, making them prime targets for cyber threats.
        In the digital age, businesses generate, store, and process vast amounts of structured and unstructured data,
        including personal information, financial records, intellectual property, and operational data. Ensuring the
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of this data is the foundation of cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>Cyber threats such as data breaches, ransomware, insider threats, and unauthorized access can lead to financial
        losses, reputational damage, and legal penalties. As a result, organizations must implement robust data protection
        strategies, including data classification, encryption, access control, and compliance with regulatory frameworks
        such as ISO 27001, GDPR, NIST, PCI-DSS, and National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) regulations.</p>
    <p>Understanding the difference between data and information is also crucial in cybersecurity. While data represents raw
        facts and figures, information is processed data that provides meaningful insights. Both must be secured, monitored,
        and managed effectively to mitigate cybersecurity risks.</p>
    <p>The following table outlines key aspects of Data & Information security in the context of cybersecurity.</p>

    <h3>Take Away</h3>
    <p>Data and information security are critical components of cybersecurity, requiring strategic planning, continuous monitoring, and regulatory compliance to mitigate risks. Organizations must enforce strong encryption, access control, data classification, and backup policies to protect sensitive information from cyber threats.</p>
    <p>As cyberattacks grow more sophisticated, cybersecurity teams must adopt advanced threat detection technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and Zero Trust frameworks, to safeguard data integrity. Additionally, compliance with global and regional data protection regulations is essential to maintaining trust, avoiding legal penalties, and ensuring operational resilience</p>
    <p>By implementing comprehensive data security strategies, organizations can ensure that data remains protected, reliable, and accessible, reducing risks associated with data breaches, insider threats, and cyberattacks.</p>
