    Review vs Audit

@section('background')
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In the domain of cybersecurity, ensuring the effectiveness of security controls, compliance with regulations, and
        continuous improvement of security postures are essential. Two key processes that help organizations assess their
        security stance are reviews and audits. While both serve as assessment mechanisms, they differ significantly in
        their objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.</p>
    <p>A review is an informal or formal process of evaluating cybersecurity policies, procedures, configurations, and
        security measures to identify gaps, areas of improvement, and potential vulnerabilities. Reviews are typically
        conducted internally and may focus on best practices, security posture assessments, or adherence to internal
        standards. They are more flexible and are often performed periodically as part of continuous monitoring.</p>
    <p>An audit, on the other hand, is a systematic, formal, and independent examination of an organization’s cybersecurity
        controls, policies, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Audits are typically conducted by internal or
        external auditors and follow a structured methodology aligned with industry standards such as ISO 27001, NIST CSF,
        PCI DSS, and GDPR. The primary goal of an audit is to ensure compliance, assess risks, and provide assurance to
        stakeholders, including regulatory bodies, executive management, and customers.</p>
    <p>Both reviews and audits play a crucial role in strengthening an organization’s cybersecurity resilience. Reviews help
        identify areas for improvement proactively, while audits provide formal assurance of compliance and adherence to
        established security frameworks. Understanding the key differences between these two assessment mechanisms is vital
        for cybersecurity professionals, including CISOs, to implement an effective governance and risk management strategy.

    <h3>Take Away</h3>
    <P>Both reviews and audits are essential in cybersecurity governance and risk management, but they serve different
        purposes. Reviews are proactive, flexible assessments that help organizations identify security weaknesses and
        improve their defenses. They are typically internal, iterative, and aimed at refining security controls based on
        evolving threats and industry best practices.</P>
    <P>Audits, on the other hand, provide formal assurance that an organization meets regulatory and compliance
        requirements. They are structured, independent evaluations that ensure an organization adheres to security
        frameworks and industry regulations. Failing an audit can result in legal consequences, financial penalties, and
        reputational damage, making audits a critical component of cybersecurity compliance.</P>
    <P>For an effective cybersecurity strategy, organizations should implement a balanced approach that includes regular
        security reviews for continuous improvement and periodic audits to ensure compliance and accountability. This
        combination enables organizations to maintain a robust security posture, minimize risks, and demonstrate their
        commitment to protecting sensitive information and critical assets.</P>
