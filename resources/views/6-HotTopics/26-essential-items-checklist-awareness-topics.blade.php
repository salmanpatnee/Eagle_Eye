    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Cybersecurity awareness is a crucial element in an organizationâ€™s defense strategy against cyber threats. Human error
        remains one of the leading causes of security breaches, making it essential to educate employees on secure practices
        for handling emails, devices, networks, data, and social media. A well-structured cybersecurity awareness program
        ensures that employees understand potential risks, recognize security threats, and apply best practices to protect
        sensitive information and organizational systems.</p>
    <p>As organizations increasingly adopt remote work (telework), cloud computing, and social media engagement, they face
        new challenges related to data security, identity protection, and safe digital practices. Cybercriminals exploit
        vulnerabilities through phishing attacks, identity theft, social engineering, and insecure network configurations,
        making it imperative for employees to follow security guidelines and report suspicious activities to the
        cybersecurity team.</p>
    <p>This checklist provides a comprehensive overview of essential cybersecurity awareness topics, covering email
        security, device protection, telework security, data handling, and social media risks. By integrating these topics
        into an ongoing security awareness training program, organizations can minimize security incidents, enhance
        regulatory compliance, and build a culture of cybersecurity resilience.</p>
